## Installation

### Pre-requisites

- Node version 12.18

### Dependencies

Install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

The project is ready to be used at this point.

## Usage

You can use this dependency once you have it installed on your project. There are multiple ways to do this:

### Use a release version 

Install with:
```bash
npm i --save @rsksmart/rif-relay-common
```

### Use a local distributable

Clone this repository inside your project's root folder and use the `npm link` mechanism (https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link) to add it to your project.

## Development

Make your modifications and then run `npm run build` to validate them.
When you are done with your changes, you can publish them by creating a distributable version.

### Husky and linters

We use husky to check linters and code styles on commits, if you commit your
changes and the commit fails on lint or prettier checks you can use these command
to check and fix the errors before trying to commit again:

* `npm run lint`: to check linter bugs
* `npm run lint:fix`: to fix linter bugs
* `npm run prettier`: to check codestyles errors
* `npm run prettier:fix`: to fix codestyles errors

### Generating a new distributable version

1. Run the `npm run dist` command to generate the `dist` folder with the distributable version inside.
2. Bump the version on the `package.json` file (not strictly needed).
3. Commit and push any changes, including the version bump.

#### For GitHub

1. Create a new tag with the new version (from `package.json`) and github actions will update npm 

#### For NPM

1. Run `npm login` to login to your account on npm registry.
2. Run `npm publish` to generate the distributable version for NodeJS.

#### For direct use (no publishing)

No extra steps are needed beyond generating the `dist` folder and merging it to `master`.
